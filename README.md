USAGE:

<b>node getfit</b> 

  listen for LINK broadcasts from an ANT-FS enabled device i.e FR910 XT/610 and downloads new files
  
<b>node getfit -d 10</b>

  downloads file at index 10
  
<b>node getfit -d</b> 

  list device directory
  
<b>node getfit -b</b>

  uses background scanning channel for ANT+ and establishes a channel when a new device/master is found. Data is written to websocket
  on i.e localhost:8093 (hostname/port can be change by editing configuration.json)
  
<b>node getfit -c</b>

  uses a continous scanning channel for ANT+ and writes data to websocket on i.e localhost:8093
  
<b>node getfit -e 10</b>

  erase file at index 10
  
Support for visualizing data from sensors are available using "Live stream" in FITView https://github.com/hkskoglund/FITView or http://fitview.azurewebsites.net.
Currently testing has been done on device profile for HRM, SDM4 and SPDCAD (GSC-10). SDM4 sends background pages with
sensor health and battery status. A low battery will be visualized with an icon and SDM health statues other than OK will be
reported. If FIT settings are imported into FITView, <i>calibration</i> factors for bike wheelsize or footpod is taken into account
when calculating speed and distance.

<b>configuration.json</b>

JSON file for configuration of ANT+/ANT-FS network keys and websocket server hostname and port.
